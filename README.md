That alternative style for phpBB boards is now available on github!

Legacy is lighter than prosilver. Its lightness is achieved by using a simpler CSS and less scripts (jQuery and plupload libraries are not loaded).

## Installation instructions

Copy the entire "legacy" directory into the "styles" folder of your phpBB installation and enable it through the Administrator Control Panel (ACP).

## How the project came about

Initially aimed solely at a retrocomputing community, the goal was to restore the compatibility with older systems by lowering the software requirements.

The style has been written with Internet Explorer support in mind (the dominant browser in the late 90's and the next decade, used to be shipped with Windows).

## phpBB requirements

For each release, the version is specified in style.cfg: the early releases were designed for phpBB 3.1, subsequent ones require phpBB 3.2 or 3.3.
